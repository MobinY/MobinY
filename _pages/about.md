I am a 5th year Ph.D. student at Stanford University in the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group within the department of Management Science & Engineering, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Irene Lo](https://sites.google.com/view/irene-lo). Before joining Stanford University, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Economics from the [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/)
A data-driven personal website


Publications
======
1. **Optimal lower bounds for universal relation, and for samplers and finding duplicates in streams**

1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.


Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
