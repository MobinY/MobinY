I am a 5th year Ph.D. student at Stanford University in the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group within the department of Management Science & Engineering, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Irene Lo](https://sites.google.com/view/irene-lo). Before joining Stanford University, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Economics from the [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/)  

I study welfare and revenue maximization in two-sided platforms, and I am particularly passionate about using matching theory to aid in the provision of equitable educational opportunities. 
In collaboration with San Francisco Unified School District, 
we are working on restructuring of the school choice system for elementary students in San Francisco,
 where we aim to provide optimal matching that ensures race, gender, and socioeconomic balance in an easily comprehensible system.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
