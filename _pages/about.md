I am a 5th year Ph.D. student at Stanford University in the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group within the department of Management Science & Engineering, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Irene Lo](https://sites.google.com/view/irene-lo). Before joining Stanford University, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Economics from the [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/)  

I study welfare and revenue maximization in two-sided platforms, and I am particularly passionate about using matching theory to aid in the provision of equitable educational opportunities. 
In collaboration with San Francisco Unified School District, 
we are working on restructuring of the school choice system for elementary students in San Francisco,
 where we aim to provide optimal matching that ensures race, gender, and socioeconomic balance in an easily comprehensible system.
