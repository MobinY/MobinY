About Me
======
I am a finishing Ph.D. student at Stanford University in the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group within the department of Management Science & Engineering, where I am fortunate to be advised by Irene Lo. Before joining Stanford, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Economics from the Sharif University of Technology. 

My research focuses on welfare and revenue maximization in stochastic platforms, with a passion for applying theory to promote equitable education.
I'm collaborating with San Francisco Unified School District to redesign their elementary school choice system,
balancing accessibility with diversity factors. This work is set to be implemented in the 2026-27 school year.
